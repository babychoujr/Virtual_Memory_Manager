Where did I run my code?
    I ran it through vscode using the command prompt.

How to run code?

Input Files:
Make sure the input files are in the same folder as the source code
Command Window commands
javac *.java - compiles all the .java files
java shell - runs the shell to create the output file

The code works by manually changing the file name to the desired input file name. 
According to the test files given, 
1. first input is "init-dp.txt"
2. second input is "input-dp.txt"
3. third input is "output-dp.txt"

The code should create an output-dp.txt file with the desired output
